## About

This app allows the user to have an easy-to-use, seamless experience of sailing across the ocean blue!

Since 1492, many people across the world have set sail across the ocean blue to find lost worlds, treasures, and even mythical places! Now, you'll be able to sail across the open water in order to find your hidden treasure, escape island, or even El Dorado!

Features:

- Sail button: phone will vibrate upon selecting the button, this simulates the open seas and how rough they can be. Argh.. it's not always smooth sailing across the deep blue sea..
- Stop button: selecting this button will stop your phone's vibrations. Throw in the anchor and take a breather.

Smooth Sailing is built using React Native and implements a vibration feature.
Developed for iOS devices.
